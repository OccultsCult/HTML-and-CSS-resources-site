   <h1>Resources for learning HTML and CSS</h1>
     <p><strong>These are resources I wanted to share for learning HTML and CSS that we use in my DIT class at school so you can learn if you want! :D</strong></p>
     <p><strong>Below this paragraph will be resources that my teacher uses to have us learn HTML and CSS, I reccomend keeping a folder on your computer thats dedicated to this stuff so everything isn't everywhere</strong></p>
